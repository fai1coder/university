# Calculation of laser heating of polymeric holographic medium with phenanthrenequinone

Subject of this work is a process of heating and translucence of polymeric holographic medium with phenanthrenequinone during hologram recording. Mathematical model based on classic heat transfer equation, equation of lightning redistribution in absorbing medium and equation of kinetic of photochemical reaction is described. 

I will post a link to paper as soon as it will be published.
